      In the Inline elements video, we learned:

Headers, paragraphs and list elements are considered block elements
Inline elements are elements included within block element tags
Some inline elements:
<strong>
<em>
<a> - with the href attribute to make a hypertext link
<img> - with the alt attribute
Here are some exercises for you to practice using inline HTML elements. Don't forget to commit your changes and push to your remote repositories on GitHub. Continue to make sure you are using proper indentation to keep your code clean and readable!

Add <strong> and <em> tags to your my-first-webpage.html, like I did in the lesson.
Link from your my-first-webpage.html to your favorite-things.html.
Add photos of your favorite things to your favorite-things.html page. Make an img folder to hold these photos and make sure the path is correctly written on your webpage.
In your favorite-things.html page, add links to your favorite websites.
Update your cat's homepage and your dog's blog with photos, links, and <strong> and <em> tags.
